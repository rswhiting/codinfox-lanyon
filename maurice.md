title: Death of Maurice
---

This is my retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Not the classic one meant to scare children but the Disney one. I don't have anything against it really, but it has some plot holes and things that just don't fit my schema. So I wrote my own. Based on experience, if you like Beauty and the Beast, you probably won't like this one.

I've had some raving reviews though:

> You're a monster.

> You ruined one of my favorite childhood memories.

With those warnings in place, enjoy.

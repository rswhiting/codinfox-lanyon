I've had the pleasure of playing many tabletop games over the last 9 years. My profession almost demands it: the analytical mind needs a place to play, and I've had some awesome friends help me unwrap the why behind many of them.

A few games started out with a lot of promise but didn't stand the test of re-playability. Here are the requirements for my games:
* Playable over a 1 hour lunch (potentially more than once) including setup, explaination, and teardown time
* Flexible number of players, usually 4-12
* Replayable with the same people
* Still fun when new people are added in

## Bang!
Bang! has stood the test of time and emerged victorious. We've worn our the cards.

### Mechanics
* Semi-hidden roles: there are 2 teams and a balancer. There's a definite team A and team B with incentive to align one way or the other and the renegade is there to even things out just in case things get too weighted to one side.
* Role upgrades: players get permenant modifiers per player.
* Teams: you're not along (unless you're the renegade)
* Equal knowledge: people only know their own role and what's publicly available, so no one is left in the dark
* Asynchronous gameplay: everyone plays differently based on their role, character, and position at the table

### Downsides
* The rules aren't very clear, especially once you get some of the expansion packs. It's good to have a Nick around to clear things up (or the internet forums to help with rulings). 
* The game length is very unpredictable, and once you're out, it's not the best experience to watch the Sheriff and a Renegade duke it out for 30 minutes.
* Renegade gameplay is usually to pretend to be a deputy for the whole game then see if they can beat the other deputies and eventually the sheriff. That's a bad strategy and makes for a long and painful game (especially for the dead outlaws).

### House rules
* Dynomite Fuse: When a dynomite comes into play roll a dice and place it on the dynomite. That's the max fuse. It changes the game mechanics for dynomite from a random damage to a known end with a chance to blow up early.
* Dual characters: Deal out all roles and pick 2. There are a few combos that break the game, but it speeds up slow games.
* Fused weapons: play two guns, get the combined best effects. This one can break the game, especially if you're playing dual characters.

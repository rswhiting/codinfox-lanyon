Brother, one of the patterns I've noticed in industry is the tendency to job hop when troubles arise. This isn't just in software. Feelings are hurt once so people move on to a new friend group. Marriages are hard, so they divorce and try to find the next The One. Staying power seems to be lacking.

The other side of it is the "stay and fix it no matter what" attidude, but that can lead to stagnation in a horrible situation. At some point it can turn into a "stay because it's familiar" instead of injecting positive change.

What's the tipping point between making where you are a better place vs leaving a bad situation? Are there obvious signs that it's time to move on, or should there be a timebox on affecting change in a situation? When is it premature to move on?

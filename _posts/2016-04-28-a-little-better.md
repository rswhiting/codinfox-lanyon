Every day, do something to move your character one step toward the place you want to be when you grow up.

<!-- more -->

If that step is to go on a walk or sit in a quiet room for an hour to figure out where you need to move your character, do that.

If you need to listen to self help books to get an idea of what some of the options are, do that.

If the words of some now-dead author will inspire you to reflection or action, do that.

But do something.

Becoming busy was never a part of the American dream. It took over the dream and turned it into something else. Culture will tell you do do a lot, but that's because there is a lot of culture out there. Instead, sit quietly, and find out what you really need to focus on.

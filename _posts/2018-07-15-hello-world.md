I've got a long way to go to migrate [my blog](https://rswhiting.com) from my own Wordpress instance to Github.io, but I think it'll be worth it. I'm already really excited about returning to Markdown without the frustration of keeping a server playing nice on the side.

Github is like a second home, and it's time I start contributing here instead of just consuming.
